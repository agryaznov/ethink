This pallet was heavily inspired by Frontier's [pallet-ethereum](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/frame/ethereum).  

It is used as a proxy in front of [pallet-contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/contracts) for the transactions coming from the Ethereum RPC.
